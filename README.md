## Description
This project recreate a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. To create this dynamic experience this project required to put together JavaScript and CSS skills.
## How to run
You just need to move your mouse over the screen and the eyes will follow that movement. You can try moving the mouse faster or slower and in any direction, even suddenly the eyes fill follow your pointer. This project also works with touch screen no mandatory use of a mouse.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I will add some background color to the screen and also try to set a face image in the background and match their eyes hole with the tracker eyes.
